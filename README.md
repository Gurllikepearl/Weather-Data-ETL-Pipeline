# Weather-Data-ETL-Pipeline
This project demonstrates a basic ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline built using Python and executed entirely from the Command Line (CMD). The pipeline extracts real-time weather data from a public REST API, transforms the data into a structured format, and loads it into a SQLite database for storage and analysis.
